    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <div class="stxt">
      <p>
        In an investigative report on health equity, Michael Marmot (2010) described a steep social gradient associated with health and the social status of people, and the complex interactivity between the economic status of people, their behaviours
        and their associated health outcomes.

        Inspired by Marmot's Work, we chose to further explore England's health inequalities on a spatial scale, and to create an impactful tool that expresses the spatial variation in ethnicities, age, economic status and health in England.

        The tool is comprised of the spatial distribution of mortality ratio for deaths from causes considered preventable, as well as proportions of preventable deaths by cause. Further, health-focused geodemographic profiles have been identified
        for each Middle Super Output Area (MSOA) in England. <b>Explore the menu below to learn more about our process. </b>

              The visualisation tool presents data at Middle Super Output Area (MSOA) Level. MSOAs are geographical areas, created to facilitate the representations of small-area statistics in England. MSOAs comprise of areas with an average
              population of 7200. The boundaries defined in 2011 were used for the analysis, comprising of 6791 areas.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              We use MSOA Level data as it is the finest spatial scale at which all the data used for analysis was available. This allows for a more detailed analysis at a scale disaggregated enough to observe local variations in the data.

          By looking at the distirbution of our variables above, we can already make a few interesting observations. The preventable deaths and IMD data both exhibit skew to the right, where the tail of the distribution is considerably longer on the
          right. This that there are a small number of MSOAs that are performing significantly poorly in terms of deaths and deprivation, driving the national average upward. <br><br>

          The distribution of ages across England, particularly those aged 64 and over suggests that there is quite a wide variation of age breakdowns in MSOAs across the country, with some areas having a significantly older or younger population.
          The distribution of ethnicities highlights the fact that most MSOAs have a significant majority white population, however there are a small number of areas where minority ethnic groups make up the majority of inhabitants. <br>

          <h2>Geodemographic Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Geodemographic analysis attempts to characterise people according to where they live and is centred on the premise that people live with others like themselves, who share similar demographics and lifestyles.Recently, there has been
            significant growth in the use of geodemographic approaches within the healthcare sector. As such, by linking our health variable – preventable deaths – to our variables focused on ethnicity, age and deprivation, we take advantage of
            geodemographics’ potential to elucidate qualitative insights and new understandings about a population. </p>

          <h2>Cluster Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            As part of our geodemographic analysis, a cluster analysis was carried out, grouping MSOAs based on their similarity to one another in terms of the variables discussed above. Our analysis makes use of the K-means clustering. Put simply,
            K-means clustering aims to group similar data together and expose underlying patterns. To achieve this goal, the clustering algorithm looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in the dataset. To determine k we made use of several metrics,
            each measuring a different thing. For instance, the total within sum of squares, silhouette coefficients, and the Davies-Bouldin index. As these metrics measure different things, the optimum number of clusters that each suggested were not
            always consistent. Thus, we combined the insight gleaned from these results with our intuition on what looked best to arrive at the final number of clusters: k = 7. </p>
