      <h1>HEALTH INEQUALITIES IN THE UK</h1>
    </div>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <div class="stxt">
        <p>
        This analysis explores the relationship between number of deaths and socio-economic influences,
        seeking to figure out whether some socio-economic influences are linked with certain causes of death.
        Additionally, the number of years lost (as a result of early death) has been explored.

        This research seeks to contribute existing literature and research regarding the relationship
        between socio-economic conditions and health in deprived areas.
